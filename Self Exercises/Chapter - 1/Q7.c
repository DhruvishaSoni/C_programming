   Q.7  Discuss the importance of the main() function in a C program. What is its significance?
*/


// Answer:


/* 

   The main() function is the entry point of every C program. It is where the program starts execution. 
   The operating system calls the main() function when the program is executed, and it returns an integer 
   value (usually 0 for success) to indicate the program’s exit status.
