/*
   Q.1  Explain the concept of data types in C language. Why are they important?
*/


// Answer:

/*
    In C language, data types define the type of data that a variable can hold. C provides several data types 
	to handle different kinds of data, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and more. Data 
	types are important because they allow the compiler to allocate the appropriate amount of memory for each 
	variable and determine how the data will be processed. They also ensure type safety by preventing the misuse 
    of variables.
