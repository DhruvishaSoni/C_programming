/*
   Q.9  How are variables initialized in C? What is the significance of initialization?
*/


// Answer:


// Variables can be initialized by assigning a value at the time of declaration:


=>  int num = 5;  // Initialization


/*
   Significance: Initializing variables ensures that they contain a known value when first used, preventing 
   undefined behavior caused by garbage values.
*/
