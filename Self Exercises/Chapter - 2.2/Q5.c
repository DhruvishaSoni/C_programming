/*
   Q.5  Define constants in C programming. Why are they used in programs?
*/


// Answer:


/*
   Constants are fixed values that do not change during the execution of a program. They are used to ensure 
   the stability of values that must remain the same, such as mathematical constants or configuration settings. 
   In C, constants can be declared using the const keyword or #define preprocessor directive.
