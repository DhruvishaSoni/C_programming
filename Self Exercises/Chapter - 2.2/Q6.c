/*
   Q.6  Explain the role of the const keyword in defining constants. Provide examples.
*/


// Answer:

/*
   The const keyword is used to define variables whose values cannot be modified after initialization.
*/

// Example:

=>  const int MAX = 100;

/*
   In this example, MAX is a constant integer, and any attempt to change its value later in the program will 
   result in an error.
*/
