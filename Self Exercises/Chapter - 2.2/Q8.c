/*
   Q.8  What is a macro in C? How is it different from a variable?
*/


// Answer:

/*
   A macro is a preprocessor directive that defines a constant or expression that is substituted into the 
   code before compilation. Macros are defined using #define.
*/

// Example:

=>  #define PI 3.14

/*
   Unlike variables, macros do not occupy memory space, and they do not have data types. Macros are replaced 
   at compile-time, while variables are evaluated at runtime.
