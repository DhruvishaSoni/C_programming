   Q.1  What is Git and what is its role in version control? Discuss the benefits of using Git in software
        development projects.
*/


// Answer:

/*
   Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously, 
   tracking changes and managing code revisions. It plays a key role in version control by allowing developers 
   to manage the history of changes to files, compare different versions, and collaborate more easily.
*/


// Benefits of using Git in software development:

*  Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on different parts of the project simultaneously.

*  History tracking: Git keeps a record of changes, allowing developers to revert to earlier versions if 
                      necessary.
                      
*  Branching: Developers can create branches to experiment with new features without affecting the main 
               codebase.
               
*  Distributed development: Every developer has a full copy of the project, ensuring that the project doesn’t 
                             rely on a single central server.
                             
*  Integration with platforms like GitHub: Simplifies sharing and management of code repositories.
