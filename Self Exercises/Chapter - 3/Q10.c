/*
   Q.10  Discuss the differences between staging and committing changes in Git.
*/


// Answer:


*  Staging: Files are prepared for commit by being added to the staging area with git add. You can review these 
            changes before committing them.
            
*  Committing: Staged files are saved into the Git history by creating a commit, which is a snapshot of the 
               changes.
