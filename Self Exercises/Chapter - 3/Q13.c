/*
   Q.13  Explain the concept of branches in Git and their role in parallel development.
*/


// Answer:

/*
   Branches in Git allow developers to work on different features, bug fixes, or experiments simultaneously 
   without affecting the main codebase. Each branch is an independent line of development that can later be 
   merged into other branches.
