/*
   Q.18  Explain the purpose of branch management strategies such as feature branching and release
         branching in Git workflows. 
*/


// Answer:


*  Feature branching: Each new feature is developed in its own branch. Once the feature is complete, the branch 
                      is merged into the main codebase.
                      
*  Release branching: A branch is created specifically for a release. Only bug fixes are applied to this branch, 
                      ensuring stability while new features continue to be developed on other branches.
