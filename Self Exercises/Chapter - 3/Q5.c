   Q.5  How do you set up repository settings such as licensing, README file, and collaboration
        options?
*/


// Answer:


*  License: When creating a repository, you can choose a license (e.g., MIT, Apache) to define how your code can 
            be used.
            
*  README file: This is typically the first file in a repository that explains the purpose, setup, and other 
                details of the project.
                
*  Collaboration options: In the repository settings, you can add collaborators by providing their GitHub 
                          usernames. You can also control access permissions (read, write, admin).
